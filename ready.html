      <p><span>When you embark on this journey you need to know 
      that you will push yourself to your absolute limit. You 
      have to always keep in mind why you started and what is 
      your ending goal. It won't always be pretty but continue 
      towards that goal because one day you will reach it. The 
      pain to get there will become part of you and you will love 
      the fact that you earned it.</span></p>
