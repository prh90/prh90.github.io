    <p>When you embark on this journey you need to know that you will push yourself to your absolute limit. You have to always keep in mind why you started and what is your ending goal. It won't always be pretty but continue towards that goal because one day you will reach it. The pain to get there will become part of you and you will love the fact that you earned it.</p>
